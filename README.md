# summer-internship

Hello! Here are the codes that I have produced so far during my summer internship at PT Global Urban Esensial, Indonesia. 

The data that I'm using for the codes are polling results from Teman Bumil, an app for Indonesian mothers. All polls are in Indonesian. Every poll consists of 2 or 3 questions. Most of the questions are non-essay and they do not require pre-processing. 

In "poll 27 text mining", I pre-processed the raw free-text responses of one of the essay question in poll 27 and created a frequency table of unigrams and bigrams of the responses. 

The frequency tables of responses to each question of each poll are imported in "shiny app for polls visualization" in csv format. The shiny app is able to visualize categorical responses of the non-essay questions in the form of pie charts, and free-text responses of the essay questions in the form of word clouds. More features will be added to the shiny app.
